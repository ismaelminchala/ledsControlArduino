# ledsControlArduino
This project presents an .ino source code for the Arduino MEGA2560. The source code implements a four leds sequence controlled by two keys which regulate sequence orientation as well as sequence speed. The programming includes some 'advance' programming techniques, such as: defensive programming, typedef struct variables, pointers, and enum variables.
